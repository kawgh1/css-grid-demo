I've never been good at CSS Grid

This project is for easy reference and practice

I had a bad habit of using flexbox for everything until I couldn't get the desired behavior -
and then I'd try to patch it with some CSS Grid like it was duck tape - **it isn't**

Rather than just use CSS Grid from the start, like you're supposed to : )

- # How do you know when to use CSS GRID and when to use Flexbox?

    - ## As a general rule, use GRID to layout the overall page layout *across screen sizes*, and Flexbox for inner UI components.

        -  A grid item can be a flex container. A flex item can also be a grid container. The latter is frequently used though.
