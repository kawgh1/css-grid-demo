This project is for CSS GRID practice and reference

I had a bad habit of using flexbox for everything - even page layouts ðŸ˜± 

I will make a habit of doing small CSS GRID mini-projects like this to keep my grid skills sharp!

- # How do you know when to use CSS GRID and when to use Flexbox?

    - # As a general rule, use GRID to layout the overall page layout *across screen sizes*, and Flexbox for inner UI components.

        -  A grid item can be a flex container. A flex item can also be a grid container. The latter is frequently used though.
